# anki-dev-tools
Utilities to Anki facilitate addon development.

Anki colleciton is somewhat annoying to navigate. Not sure what all I am going to need for my projects ultimately.

Currently, this addon merely adds a button to Tools to show a textbox containing the Deck JSON for the current collection. This is the saved DB data, not the live deck state.
